# Smart Waste Classification System

## Overview

This project builds an **AI-based image classification system** that automatically classifies waste into three categories:

* Recyclable Waste
* Organic Waste
* Non-Recyclable Waste

The system uses **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** and **Transfer Learning** to improve waste segregation for smart city waste management.

### Dataset Structure

```
dataset/
 ├── train/
 │    ├── recyclable/
 │    ├── organic/
 │    └── non_recyclable/
 │
 └── validation/
      ├── recyclable/
      ├── organic/
      └── non_recyclable/
```

## Data Preprocessing

* Image resizing to **224×224**
* Pixel normalization (**rescale = 1./255**)
* Data augmentation:

  * Rotation
  * Horizontal flip
  * Zoom

---

## CNN Model

The custom CNN model includes:

* Convolution layers
* MaxPooling layers
* Dense layer
* Softmax output layer for 3-class classification

---

## Model Evaluation

Model performance evaluated using:

* **Accuracy score**
* **Confusion matrix**
* **Sample predictions on test images**

---

## Transfer Learning

A pretrained model such as **MobileNetV2 / ResNet50 / VGG16** is used to improve performance by:

* Freezing base layers
* Adding custom classification layers
* Training the model on the waste dataset

---

## Result

Transfer learning models generally achieve **higher accuracy and faster training** compared to the custom CNN model.

---

## Tools & Technologies

* Python
* TensorFlow / Keras
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* Scikit-learn

---

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates how deep learning can be applied to **automate waste classification**, helping improve recycling and smart waste management systems.








#Project 2

# AI Research Assistant for Students

## Overview

This project develops a **prototype AI Research Assistant** using a **Large Language Model (LLM)** to help students quickly understand academic articles. The system can summarize long text, extract insights, answer questions, and generate concise explanations.

---

## Features

* Summarize long research articles
* Extract key insights from text
* Answer questions about the content
* Generate concise explanations

---

## Task 1 – LLM Interaction

* Used an LLM API (OpenAI / Gemini / HuggingFace).
* Sent a research article as input.
* Generated a summarized output using Python.

---

## Task 2 – Prompt Engineering

Three prompting techniques were tested:

**1. Zero-Shot Prompt**

* Model summarizes text without examples.

**2. Few-Shot Prompt**

* Provided example summaries before summarizing new text.

**3. Chain-of-Thought Prompt**

* Model analyzes the article step-by-step before generating a summary.

---

## Task 3 – Prompt Optimization

An improved prompt was designed to produce:

* **3 key insights**
* **1 actionable takeaway**
* **Professional executive summary**

Tested on two different research articles.

---

## Task 4 – Tokenization

Used a tokenizer (HuggingFace / tiktoken) to:

* Tokenize a paragraph
* Count total tokens
* Display tokenized output

---

## Task 5 – Mini AI Tool

Built a simple AI assistant that:

* Accepts article text as input
* Sends prompt to an LLM
* Generates:

  * Short summary
  * Key insights
  * One actionable recommendation

---

## Technologies Used

* Python
* LLM API (OpenAI / Gemini / HuggingFace)
* Transformers / Tokenizer
* Jupyter Notebook

---

## Conclusion

The AI Research Assistant demonstrates how **Large Language Models can help students quickly understand complex academic content** by summarizing articles and extracting meaningful insights.
